## Hi, I'm Mark. 

- I'm cofounder of Fitzwater Labs where we develop bespoke software and AI solutions for our clients.
- I have strong research interests in philosophy of science, mind, and law, particularly questions related to the nature of and role which laws play in our scientific theories.

## Research (in progress)
- Spinozan Minds in the Marketplace of Ideas (arguing that the typical cartesian model of active belief acquisition fails to account for Spinozan insights which ought to undermine our confidence in the "Marketplace of Ideas" as a tool to determine truth).

- The Mystery Objection and Non-Scientific Law (arguing that humean critiques stemming from the "mysteriousness" of governance fail to motivate skepticism about non-humean or governing conceptions of law).
